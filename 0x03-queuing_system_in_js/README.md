# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a queuing system using Node.js, Express.js, and Redis. It utilizes the deprecated Kue library for queuing tasks asynchronously.

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Redis
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Kue (deprecated)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without assistance:
- Running a Redis server on your machine
- Performing basic operations with the Redis client
- Using a Redis client with Node.js for asynchronous operations
- Storing hash values in Redis
- Handling asynchronous operations with Redis
- Implementing a queue system using Kue
- Building a basic Express.js application interacting with a Redis server
- Integrating a queue system with an Express.js application

## Requirements
- Environment: Ubuntu 18.04, Node.js 12.x, Redis 5.0.7
- All files should end with a newline
- Code files should use the `.js` extension
- Mandatory files:
  - `package.json`
  - `.babelrc` (if applicable)
- After cloning, run `$ npm install` to install dependencies
